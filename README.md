# LoveLetterTypewriterTTL
A font that had been used in "lain"
---

[Demo](https://akira-miyake.github.io/LoveLetterTypewriterTTL/)

This font is based on what Chiaki J. Konaka has published [here](http://www.konaka.com/alice6/lain/resources.html).  
I fixed some warnings in the font and converted it to a format that can be used as a web font.  

+ `LoveLetterTypewriter.ttf`
  + A modified font from which web fonts are generated
+ `webfontkit/`
  + Generated by [Webfont Generator](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator)
+ `originals/`
  + Original resources from Chiaki J. Konaka's website

This font currently does not contain many glyphs.  
If you give me glyph vector data, I will add it to the font. Of course, you are welcome to add to the ttf file..
